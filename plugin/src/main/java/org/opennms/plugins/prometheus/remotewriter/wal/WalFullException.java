 *
 * <p>The caller ({@code PrometheusRemoteWriterStorage.store()} under
 * the wal-enabled path) converts this to an
 * {@code org.opennms.integration.api.v1.timeseries.StorageException}
 * and increments {@code samples_dropped_wal_full_total} — so the
 * failure mode is operator-visible at the same counter regardless of
 * which overflow policy is active.

 * <p>{@link #evictedFramesBeforeFailure()} reports any frames the
 * writer had already evicted under DROP_OLDEST before giving up — may
 * be non-zero in the rare configuration where a single frame is
 * larger than the entire cap (which is always an operator
 * misconfiguration).
