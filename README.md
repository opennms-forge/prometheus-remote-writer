# OpenNMS Prometheus Remote Writer

[![CI](https://github.com/labmonkeys-space/prometheus-remote-writer/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/labmonkeys-space/prometheus-remote-writer/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

An OpenNMS Horizon plugin that pushes performance data to any
Prometheus-compatible Remote Write endpoint — Prometheus, Cortex, Grafana
Mimir, VictoriaMetrics, Thanos Receive — and surfaces OpenNMS resource
context (node identity, foreign-source qualification, surveillance
categories, interface descriptors) as native Prometheus labels. Query
your OpenNMS time-series data with PromQL directly from Grafana's
Prometheus data source — no OpenNMS REST round-trip at query time.

## Compatibility

| Component             | Required                       |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|
| OpenNMS Horizon Core  | 35+                            |
| JVM                   | Temurin / OpenJDK 17           |

| Integration API       | `opennms-integration-api` 2.0  |

## Install

```bash
# 1. Drop the KAR into Karaf's deploy/ directory.
curl -L -o /opt/opennms/deploy/prometheus-remote-writer.kar \
    https://github.com/labmonkeys-space/prometheus-remote-writer/releases/latest/download/prometheus-remote-writer-kar.kar

# 2. Tell OpenNMS to use the integration TSS strategy.
echo 'org.opennms.timeseries.strategy = integration' \
    >> /opt/opennms/etc/opennms.properties.d/timeseries.properties

# 3. Point the plugin at a Remote Write endpoint.
cat > /opt/opennms/etc/org.opennms.plugins.tss.prometheus-remote-writer.cfg <<EOF
write.url = https://mimir.example.com/api/v1/push
read.url  = https://mimir.example.com/prometheus
EOF

# 4. Restart OpenNMS. From the Karaf shell, verify with:
#    opennms:prometheus-writer-stats
```

The published [docs site](https://labmonkeys-space.github.io/prometheus-remote-writer/)
covers full configuration, wire-format selection (v1 / v2), the WAL,
label mapping, backend compatibility, operations, and troubleshooting.

## Build from source

```bash
make help          # list everything available
make build         # compile, run unit tests, install locally
make verify        # unit + integration tests (needs Docker)
make kar           # build assembly/kar/target/*.kar
make smoke         # e2e against all backends
make docs          # render single-page HTML to docs/target/generated-docs
```

The build is fronted by a `Makefile` over the Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`); CI
invokes `make` targets, never raw Maven. See [`Makefile`](Makefile) for
the full target list.
